The only thing I got on my WWDC wishlist was Siri for <strike>OS X</strike>macOS and continued support for Objective-C. The continued support for Objective-C was the more interesting of the two.

I was pleasantly surprised by the new APFS filesystem, however like others I am concerned about the lack of checksumming. Lets see if that gets addressed before it starts to roll out in 2017. 

There are some enhancements to the dev tools which will help with Vienna development and I hope to outline them in more detail as I start to use them.
