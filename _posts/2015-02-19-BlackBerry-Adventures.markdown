Today has been another great day of freedom, though unfortunately I've spent most of it
toying with BlackBerry 10 development.
There are large gaps in the BlackBerry developer documentation that you need to try and fill
using QT developer documentation. 

I'm having a hell of a time with the Momentics IDE too - I just can't seem to get auto-complete working.
As I don't know my way around QT or BlackBerry Cascades very well I am constantly looking up documentation to try and find the correct function name for things.

My goal is to get some decent MVVM building blocks in place so that I can leverage them for quick & easy app development. I'm nearly there though so I have that going for me which is nice...
