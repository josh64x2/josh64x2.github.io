These are some of the things I hope Apple unveil at WWDC next week:

* Ability to change default apps (e.g. browser) in iOS 10
* Continued support and enhancements for Objective-C
* Siri SDK & integration for OS X
* New pro hardware with the ability for users to upgrade RAM
* A more reasonably priced Mac Pro for Australia
* An updated thunderbolt display with USB 3.0 as well as a 5K thunderbolt display

Lets see if I get anything on that list. ðŸ™‚
